PLC Data logging goes here. 
Updated Format:
OMNI_hour_date.csv

Explaination:
OMNI_ --> this log includes all items for: "R513A_UNIT", "LOGGER", "TEST_STATION", "CHAMBER"
hour  --> This is the hour (1-24) in which the log was created. This was done becuase of the huge filesize that occurs when logging everything to one file.
date  --> Date the log was created.

Structural Notes:
The csv has a 2 Row header.
First row, First column of respective logs:
"R513A_UNIT", "LOGGER", "TEST_STATION", "CHAMBER"

Second Row:
Registers of respective devices.



Currently: 286 (NP) registers from 4 seperate devices are being logged to one file. 

Discussion:
Could we make the logs even longer? Multiple hours?? Sure!
but at some point, we're going to hit data limits on file sizes on github.
not to mention uploading large datasets could have unintended effects on the fragile network.
Then there is the scripting component. which is easy to make a script do with github, on linux. 

I would need to research more to use whatever other suite, or gdrive, find an apt place to put logs, yada yada yada. 
Im sure we can do it, When? Where? How? no idea.
