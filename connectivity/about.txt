Program operational logs, not related to the data being logged, rather related to the program and network connectivity.
Also intended to update at midnight daily... once that feature is implemented.
  
Things to know about connectivity log:
The current program reports when the program reconnects, with date and time.
If connectivity is lost, the program will retry 5 times to reconnect consecutively.
If the program fails 5 times to reconnect, it will wait 10 seconds, then try the the 
Reconnection process again.

Durring this time, logging to the output file will still log, but the values reccorded 
in this time will probably be "ERR"

Edge Case: PLC connectivity is re-established mid read register operation: 
Result: some values in the Line output will read "ERR"
Please note, that these values may not be linear, the registes are listed in order, but not read in order.

Output logs headers are sorted by their appearance in the REGISTERS list, while their reading occurs in batches, 
based on memory allocation, and register block size. 

The puprose of this logging section is to improve the application performance and network opeartion, 
by logging events that occur in the programs connectivity, and operation.
